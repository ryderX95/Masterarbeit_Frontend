      {/* Description */}
      <p className="mb-4">
        Authentication enumeration is a fundamental aspect of security testing, concentrating specifically on the mechanisms that protect sensitive aspects of web applications.
        This process involves methodically inspecting various authentication components ranging from username validation to password policies and session management.
        Each of these elements is meticulously tested because they represent potential vulnerabilities that, if exploited, could lead to significant security breaches.
